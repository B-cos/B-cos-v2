# Introduction
This repository contains the code for the B-cos v2 models. (_Paper coming soon!_)

These models are more efficient and easier to train than the original B-cos models. Furthermore, we make a 
large number of pretrained B-cos models available for use.

If you want to take a quick look at the explanations the models generate, 
you can try out the Gradio web demo on [![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nps1ngh/B-cos).

If you prefer a more hands-on approach, 
you can take a look at the [demo notebook on `Colab`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bdc1zdIVvv7XUJj8B8Toe6VMPYAsIT9w?usp=sharing)
or load the models directly via `torch.hub` as explained below.

If you simply want to copy the model definitions, we provide a minimal, single-file reference implementation including
explanation mode in [`extra/minimal_bcos_resnet.py`](extra/minimal_bcos_resnet.py)!


**UPDATE**: We have also released our ViT models! See [Model Zoo](#model-zoo).


# Quick Start
You only need to make sure you have `torch` and `torchvision` installed. 

Then, loading the models via `torch.hub` is as easy as:

```python
import torch

# list all available models
torch.hub.list('B-cos/B-cos-v2')

# load a pretrained model
model = torch.hub.load('B-cos/B-cos-v2', 'resnet50', pretrained=True)
```

Inference and explanation visualization is as simple as:
```python
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# load image
img = model.transform(Image.open('cat.jpg'))
img = img[None].requires_grad_()

# predict and explain
model.eval()
expl_out = model.explain(img)
print("Prediction:", expl_out["prediction"])  # predicted class idx
plt.imshow(expl_out["explanation"])
plt.show()
```

Each of the models has its inference transform attached to it, accessible via `model.transform`.
Furthermore, each model has a `.explain()` method that takes an image tensor and returns a dictionary
containing the prediction and the explanation, and some extras.
<!-- TODO: add link to docs if end up making a site for them -->
See the [demo notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bdc1zdIVvv7XUJj8B8Toe6VMPYAsIT9w?usp=sharing)
for more details on the `.explain()` method.

Furthermore, each model has a `get_classifier` and `get_feature_extractor` method that return the
classifier and feature extractor modules respectively. These can useful for fine-tuning the models!

<!-- =============================================================================================================== -->

# Installation
Depending on your use case, you can either install the `bcos` package 
or set up the development environment for training the models (for your custom models or for reproducing the results).

## `bcos` Package
If you are simply interested in using the models (pretrained or otherwise), 
then we provide a `bcos` package that can be installed via `pip`:

```bash
pip install bcos
```

This contains the models, their modules, transforms, and other utilities 
making it easy to use and build B-cos models.
Take a look at the public API [here](bcos/__init__.py). 
(I'll add a proper docs site if I have time or there's enough interest. 
Nonetheless, I have tried to keep the code well-documented, so it should be easy to follow.)

## Training Environment Setup
If you want to train your own B-cos models using this repository or are interested in reproducing the results, 
you can set up the development environment as follows:

Using `conda` (recommended, especially if you want to reproduce the results):
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate bcos
```

Using `pip`
```bash
pip install -r requirements-train.txt
```

### Setting Data Paths
You can either set the paths in [`bcos/settings.py`](bcos/settings.py) or set the environment variables
1. `DATA_ROOT`
2. `IMAGENET_PATH`

to the paths of the data directories.

The `DATA_ROOT` environment variable should point to the data root directory for CIFAR-10 
(will be automatically downloaded).
For ImageNet, the `IMAGENET_PATH` environment variable should point to the directory containing 
the `train` and `val` directories.



<!-- =============================================================================================================== -->

# Usage
For the `bcos` package, as mentioned earlier, take a look at the public API [here](bcos/__init__.py).

For evaluating or training the models, you can use the `evaluate.py` and `train.py` scripts, as follows:

## Evaluation
You can use evaluate the accuracy of the models on the ImageNet validation set using:
```bash
python evaluate.py --dataset ImageNet --hubconf resnet18
```
This will download the model from `torch.hub` and evaluate it on the ImageNet validation set.
The default batch size is 1, but you can change it using the `--batch-size` argument.
Replace `resnet18` with any of the other models listed in [Model Zoo](#model-zoo) that you wish to evaluate.

## Training
Short version:
```bash
python train.py \
  --dataset ImageNet \
  --base_network bcos_final \
  --experiment_name resnet18
```

Long version: See [TRAINING.md](TRAINING.md) for more details on 
how the setup works and how to train your own models.

# Model Zoo
Here are the ImageNet pre-trained models available in the model zoo.
